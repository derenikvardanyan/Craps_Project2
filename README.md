This is a game that has the following rules` 
1) Two dices are required to play and a player rolls two six-sided dice and adds the numbers rolled together.

2) If on the first roll a player encounters a total of 7 or 11 the player automatically wins, and if the player rolls a total of 2, 3, or 12 the player automatically loses, and play is over. 

3) If a player rolls a total of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on their first roll, that number becomes the ‘point. Then the player continues to roll the two dice again until one of two things happens either they roll the ‘point’ again, in which case they win, or they roll a 7, in which case they lose.
